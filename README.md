# Textual Keys

A simple terminal-based tool that helps you discover what keys turn up in a
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) application, as sent by your
terminal. It also helps you discover the names of the keys -- useful when
you want to create textual `Binding`s for them.

To install:

```sh
$ pipx install textual-keys
```

and then to run:

```sh
$ textual-keys
```

Note that <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> will quit the application so, of
course, that particular key combination will never be shown.
